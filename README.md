# Space-Time A star Algorthm
Welcome to the Space-time A* Algorithm Project, an advanced iteration of the classic A* pathfinding algorithm tailored for complex, multi-dimensional navigation challenges. 
This project extends the traditional A* algorithm into the space-time continuum, enabling the consideration of both spatial and temporal dimensions for dynamic and efficient route planning.

**Currently, this algorithm is implemented in a task assignment model for a multi-AGV based intelligent logistics sorting system, aiming to calculate the optimal delivery positions for goods sorting.**
